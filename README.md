## Context
As main contributors for this repo, we started by installing the dependencies needed to test this activity tracker application. `Mocha` and `chai` created the testing envioroment for the realization of this project. As a team we made the decision early in the project to implement dependencies such as `moment.js` and `chart.js` to to manipulte and display data. While testing we created dummy-test-data that then we used to prepare the proper testing enviroment. Fit-lit was a project were we practiced our knowledge on ES6 javaScript syntax as well as installing packages using `npm`.

#### Technologies used:
  * JavaScript
  * Terminal
  * GitHub
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Dependencies

## Challenges
  * struggled with chart JS implementation specifically with flexible reusability
  * Was unsure how to handle "user images" and had to try a few routes
  * Responsiveness still isn't exactly where we would like it, though its a good start
  * Struggled to get enough refactoring done in the first place, and generally done on time.
  * didn't "meet" all our milestone dates, primarily because of how we set them at the beginning, more so than running behind.

## Wins
  * TTD, chai-testing library and mocha-framework set up.
  * Project planning and organization
  * Array prototype methods
  * Use of dependencies such as `moment.js` and `chart.js`
  * Practice OOP while creating the application
  * Using the project board * issues, labels and tickets* to keep track of my progress

## Future Goals
  * Add functionality to the menu button
  * Adding functionality to store and display new data from users
  * Refactor classes

## In Action

#### Take 1
* When the user is opens the application using the browser, the user can see the navigation bar that displays the "challenge of day". The user also has the opportunity to choose to display the information from 5 different users using the drop down menu. On the right side of the navigation bar, the user can also display old data by choosing a different date from the menu of dates.

#### Take 2
* The application has been divided into different sections:
  - Activity Hydration, sleep, friends list and friends goals

#### Take 3
* Responsivess was built by using media queries
